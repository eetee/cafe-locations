## Locator for cafes stocking Supreme coffee

- Single page site which uses browser's location to identify current location
- Uses list of cafes found here: http://www.easymapmaker.com/map/CSLcafelocations
- Uses lat/lon co-ordinates to determine approximate distance ([as the crow flies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_the_crow_flies) - good enough for determining relative order)
- Displays list of cafes ordered by distance
- Displays cafe's map (using Google Map API) ~ clicking on directions works as well

## Disclaimer
I have no affiliation to the roaster, they have neither commissioned this nor is there any endorsement.

## Potential Enhancements

- Use opening times to filter list of cafes
- Use driving distance (from Google Maps) instead of lat/lon
- Make it not ugly
